Steps taken to get FileZilla to compile:

FIRST OF ALL: I made a snapshot of the VM before installing the dependencies, so if I messed something up, I can just rollback to that

First, get wxWidgets dependency
NOTE: pretty much all of these require root
apt-get install curl
curl http://apt.wxwidgets.org/key.asc | apt-get add -
edit /etc/apt/sources.list to add:
# wxWidgets/wxPython repository at apt.wxwidgets.org
    deb http://apt.wxwidgets.org/ jessie-wx main
    deb-src http://apt.wxwidgets.org/ jessie-wx main
NOTE: if not on the VM provided for the class, it will be something else besides jessie for the distribution name
apt-get update (updates the package list so it knows to actually download stuff right!)
apt-get install wx2.8 (not needed?)
apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev (this is probably the one I actually needed)

apt-get install libidn11-dev
apt-get install libgnutls-dev
apt-get install libdbus-1-dev
apt-get install libtinyxml-dev (could avoid this with ./configure --with-tinyxml=builtin, but where's the fun in taht?)
apt-get install xdg-utils
apt-get install libgtk+2.0-dev (maybe just libgtk2.0-dev works?)
apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

Some of these (especially the GTK one) can take a while since they download/update a lot of stuff. Maybe there's a way to refine it to get only the bare bones, but I was too lazy
THEN, back in the trunk folder of FileZilla:
./autogen.sh

Do anything else it tells you to do, I forget if I needed anything else from it

./configure (if it gives you errors, try to deal with them)
make
filezilla can then be run at /compile/src/interface/filezilla
